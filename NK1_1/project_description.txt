This project is regarding the development of a hoist simulation. A hoist is a octogonal box where there are two motors x and z. Those motors can move the hoist in x and z axis in the bounds 0-max_x and 0-max_z respectively. 
There is a command console which will get input for the user to increase o decrease the x and z axis or also to stop them. Corresponding keys will be pressed using keyboard.  
An inspection console is used to manage the set and reset keys and reporting  the real time hoist positions on the screen.
A watchdog process to stop the above consoles periodically and reset after 60 sec of idleness. 
The motor x and z process recieves commands from the command console and moves the hoist alng its respective axis and sends its position coordiantes to the inspection console.

A master process launces all the process at the same time.


Inside this .zip archive you have sources archive, where you can see six folders containing the codes with a .txt file of the codes description .

To unzip sources archive and install the program -

source ./install.sh <pathname>

secondly to run the program -

./run.sh
