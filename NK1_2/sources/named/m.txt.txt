M Prcocess :


This process is responsible to analyze the data and outputs of the form :

no. of G1|G2 cycles: xx
no. of messages received: xx
offset delay in G1 | G2 cycles (usec): xx
average delay (latency) between generation and reception of messages (usec): xx
estimated bandwidth between G and R (bit/s): xx

The communication between R and M is handled via named pipes.
