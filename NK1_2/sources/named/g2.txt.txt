G2 Process:

	This process generates a short messages composed by a time stamp, the process identifier and a little datum identifying the message itself using a 
							struct message()
The messages created in a strict loop are sent to the process R. At any cycle a delay is applied before sending the message. The delay is computed as 
							delay=high +random(low,high);

This model simulates the generation of quasi-periodic messages by a sensor at varibale rate (depending on the value of offset).
