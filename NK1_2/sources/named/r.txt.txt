R process :

This process is a non deterministic receiver of the messages, wiht the aim of receiving as many message as possible without blocking G1 nad G2. 
The R puts the messages generated by G1 and G2 in a queue in same order they are recieved.
R is terminated after 1 million cycles of both G1 and G2. Then R sends the messages, the time of recieve of messages to M process through a named pipes.
